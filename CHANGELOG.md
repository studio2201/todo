## [Unreleased] - 2026-07-23

### Changed
- **Audit Wave**: Org-wide consolidation of `shared-assets` usage.
  The shared crate (v3.0.34..v3.0.37) now hosts the workspace
  inheritance, the `rate_limit::RateLimiter`, `session_id::generate_session_id`,
  `cookie_auth::{build_cookie, cookie_should_be_secure}`, the shared
  `Login` component, `app_error::AppError`, and
  `auth::origin_check::{origin_matches, forbidden_response, ...}`.
  The web apps' duplicated auth helpers, config, types, security
  headers, CSS, and `bin/sh/tui.rs` shells have been removed in
  favour of the shared implementations.
- **Pre-wave**: Removed the per-app interactive TUI admin console
  in favour of the existing CUI subcommands.
- **Per-app refactor**: file size cap enforcement (≤ 250 LoC/.rs)
  applied where the audit flagged oversize files.


## [1.0.20] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
- **Container Cleanup**: Renamed misleading `Containerfile.ubi` to standard `Containerfile` (the build target remains optimized Alpine Linux).

## [1.0.19] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
- **RFC Compliance**: Updated `shared-assets` to `v3.0.32` to inherit standard RFC 7235 compliance (`WWW-Authenticate` headers for unauthorized responses).

## [1.0.18] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- **Write Race Condition**: Introduced a sync lock (`todos_lock`) on the `save_todos` endpoint to prevent concurrent writes from corrupting or overwriting `todos.json` state.

## [1.0.17] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
- **Code Review & Splitting**: Partitioned large monolithic files (including the sh admin console) into logical modules to ensure no single file exceeds 250 lines of code.
- **UI Links Cleanup**: Updated shared assets dependency to remove the version link in the header and the GitHub/Coffee links in the footer.


## [1.0.16] - 2026-07-19

### Security
- **CI Workflow Security**: Declared GITHUB_TOKEN read-only content permissions in the GitHub Actions workflow to resolve CodeQL scanning warnings.


## [1.0.15] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
- **Favicon update**: Synchronized the web application favicon with the new 2-color neon squircle icon.


## [1.0.14] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- **TUI execution fix**: Resolved argument routing issue in the main entry point of the admin tool, enabling the "tui" parameter to launch the interactive dashboard successfully.


## [1.0.13] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
- **Uniform Rounded Icon**: Applied a rounded corner mask with white-filled borders to make all application icons perfectly uniform.


## [1.0.12] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
- **Simple Bright Icon**: Replaced application icon with a simple high-contrast 2-color flat-art neon cyan and purple vector illustration on a dark navy blue background.


## [1.0.11] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- **Warning fix**: Removed unused mutable keyword on server command spawn to prevent warning compilation failures in CI runners.


## [1.0.10] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
- **Release build bump**: Preparing new version release to trigger automated package container compilation on GHCR.


## [1.0.9] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
- **Slim Branding Banner**: Replaced the repository header banner with a slim, flat-art twilight landscape of Cheney, WA (home of the server) featuring rolling hills, Ponderosa pines, and a soaring neon eagle.


## [1.0.8] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
- **Containerized Admin Console integration**: Named the admin tool after the application (`todo`) and copied it to the container's system path `/usr/local/bin/todo`. The TUI can now be launched by simply executing `todo tui` (or `todo`) inside the container shell.
- **Documentation Modernization**: Rewrote `README.md` to remove CI details, format CLI commands as tables, and purge local development guides.


## [1.0.7] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
- **Containerized Admin Console integration**: Named the admin tool after the application (`todo`) and copied it to the container's system path `/usr/local/bin/todo`. The TUI can now be launched by simply executing `todo tui` (or `todo`) inside the container shell.
- **Documentation Modernization**: Rewrote `README.md` to remove CI details, format CLI commands as tables, and purge local development guides.
